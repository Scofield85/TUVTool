The program will automatically interpolate the data, perform hotspot analysis and cluster analysis and then visualize the results in 2D and 3D. Below are snapshots of the application\r\n\r\n### Instruction\r\nCurrently the application should run in a local R shiny mode.  We provide Manitowoc site as an example to illustrate how to use the application.The example data can be downloaded here.\r\n\r\n* Step 1: Upload the file\r\n* Step 2: Find the index\r\n* Step 3: Calculate\r\n* Step 4: Visualize\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWenzhao Xu (@stormxuwz), Ph.D in Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign",
