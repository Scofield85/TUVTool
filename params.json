The program will automatically interpolate the data, perform hotspot analysis and cluster analysis and then visualize the results in 2D and 3D. Below are snapshots of the application\r\n\r\n### Instruction\r\nCurrently the application should run in a local R shiny mode.  We provide sample data from Manitowoc site to illustrate how to use the application.The example data can be downloaded here. After download the source code:\r\n\r\n* Step 0: Modify config.R\r\n\r\nIn config.R, change \r\n\r\n    config$outputFolder <- \"~/Developer/Triaxus/output/\"\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n    config$outputFolder <- $your_output_folder\r\n\r\nThe analyzed results will be stored in this local folder. \r\n\r\n* Step 1: Upload the file\r\n\r\nClick \"choose File\" under **Select New File** and upload the Manitowoc_01.csv. The right plot will show the depths of SeaBird Sensors and Fluoprobe Sensors within the range of from/to above\r\n\r\nIf You want to combine the results of \"Manitowoc_01\" with previous results. Upload the previous results under **Select Previous Result File**.\r\n\r\n* Step 2: Find the index of sensors to align the data\r\nChange From/to to find the Seabird Index and FluoProbe Index. For example, by selecting from = 800 and to to = 10000. The red circle in the plot below should represents the same valley positions. Input the index in **Suggested Anchor Index** to the left. \r\n\r\n* Step 3: Choose the analyzing range\r\nTUV may float on the surface and the data will contains a lot of noise. Choose the data range so that the vehicle is actually undulating. For example, choose from = 800 and to = 10000, input the value to the left\r\n\r\n![Step 1-3](img/2dvis.JPG)\r\n\r\n![step 1-3](http://jmcglone.com/img/guides/git-basics.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Step 4: Calculate\r\nBy clicking \"Preprocessing\", The Map panel should pop up to show the path in the map.(You may need double click). Then Click \"click\". A notification will pop up on the upper right corner, indicating the status. The results will be saved into your ouputFolder with a name as \"allTriaxus_upto_Manitowoc_01.rds\". This is a file storing an R object that contains the raw data,cleaned data and interpolation results. This is also the file that should be uploaded in step 1 if you choose to continue analyzing Manitowoc_02.csv so that the results of Manitowoc2 will be combined with Manitowoc1.\r\n\r\n![Step 4](https://github.com/stormxuwz/projectImages/TUVTools/step_b.jpg)\r\n\r\n* Step 5: Visualize\r\nClick Visualize Panel, upload the \"allTriaxus_upto_XXX.rds\" file. The program will perform as a visualization tool to visualize the path results contains in \"allTriaxus_upto_XXX.rds\" file, including Raw data visualization, interpolation visualization in 2D and 3D and cluster analysis.  The 3D visualization might be slow since R shiny needs to send all plots information to the browser. \r\n\r\n![Step 5](https://github.com/stormxuwz/projectImages/TUVTools/step_c.jpg)\r\n\r\n![2D Visualization](https://github.com/stormxuwz/projectImages/TUVTools/2dvis.jpg)\r\n![3D Visualization](https://github.com/stormxuwz/projectImages/TUVTools/3dvis.png)\r\n![3D hotspot](https://github.com/stormxuwz/projectImages/TUVTools/hot3d.jpg)\r\n![3D cluster](https://github.com/stormxuwz/projectImages/TUVTools/cluster.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWenzhao Xu (@stormxuwz), Ph.D in Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign",
